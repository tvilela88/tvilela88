Hey all, Iâ€™m Tacio Vilela (@tvilela88) and in this GitHub I will be posting my portfolio in the data analytics career.
- Iâ€™m interested in working with people who are ambitious, communicative and prioritize family and an active life style.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently practising SQL on a daily basis, but also like working with visualization on Tableau and sometimes data filtering and scanning on python.

- ðŸ“« you can reach me on taciovilela@live.com, +55 49 988976415 (Brazil) and +351 927 733 386 (Portugal).
